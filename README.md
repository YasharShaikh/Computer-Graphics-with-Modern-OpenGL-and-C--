Welcome to my learning repository for the "Modern Graphics Using OpenGL and C++" course! Here, I'll be sharing the knowledge and code snippets I've acquired while mastering modern graphics programming techniques using OpenGL and C++.

## Repo Overview
This Repo will cover  comprehensive understanding of modern graphics techniques, covering topics such as:

*   Creation of 3D graphical applications using C++ and OpenGL
*   Utilization and comprehension of GLEW and GLFW libraries
*   Rendering 3D objects within a window
*   Implementation of OpenGL shaders (vertex, fragment, and geometry shaders)
*   Application of textures to 3D models
*   Integration of lighting models (e.g., Phong Lighting)
*   Incorporation of various types of lights (e.g., Directional, Point, and Spot Lights)
*   Utilization of shadow techniques such as Shadow Mapping
*   Importing 3D models from external applications using the Assimp library
*   Implementation of a user-controlled camera for navigation
